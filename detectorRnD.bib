	Abstract = {Extremely radiation hard sensors are needed in particle physics experiments to instrument the region near the beam pipe. Examples are beam halo and beam loss monitors at the Large Hadron Collider, FLASH or XFEL. Currently artificial diamond sensors are widely used. In this paper single crystal sapphire sensors are considered as a promising alternative. Industrially grown sapphire wafers are available in large sizes, are of low cost and, like diamond sensors, can be operated without cooling. Here we present results of an irradiation study done with sapphire sensors in a high intensity low energy electron beam. Then, a multichannel direction-sensitive sapphire detector stack is described. It comprises 8 sapphire plates of 1 cm 2 size and 525 m thickness, metallized on both sides, and apposed to form a stack. Each second metal layer is supplied with a bias voltage, and the layers in between are connected to charge-sensitive preamplifiers. The performance of the detector was studied in a 5 GeV electron beam. The charge collection efficiency measured as a function of the bias voltage rises with the voltage, reaching about10\%?at 095 V. The signal size obtained from electrons crossing the stack at this voltage is about 02200 e, where e is the unit charge. The signal size is measured as a function of the hit position, showing variations of up to 20\% in the direction perpendicular to the beam and to the electric field. The measurement of the signal size as a function of the coordinate parallel to the electric field confirms the prediction that mainly electrons contribute to the signal. Also evidence for the presence of a polarisation field was observed.},

The real-time determination of the parameters is a challenge, but is mandatory to achieve the best possible luminosity for the ILC. We report on our studies about the possibilities to reduce the number of readout channels of BeamCal without significant loss of precision in the beam parameter determination. In addition, the benefit of measuring the beamstrahlung photons energy using GamCal is evaluated. Finally we report on the achievable precision of and the observed correlations between the beam parameters reconstructed in the multi-parameter regime. We also comment on possible solutions how to deal with these correlations.},

The cylindrical spectrometer configuration with a thin superconducting solenoid magnet is optimized to provide a large geometrical acceptance of 0.5--1.0 m2sr for these scientific objectives. The spectrometer system has been completed and is planned to be launched for the first scientific flight from Lynn Lake, Canada, in 1993. This report describes the progress of the spectrometer development and discuss about its capability to search for primordial antimatter in cosmic rays. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The innovative GridPix detector is a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) that is read out with a Timepix-1 pixel chip. By using wafer post-processing techniques an aluminium grid is placed on top of the chip. When operated, the electric field between the grid and the chip is sufficient to create electron induced avalanches which are detected by the pixels. The time-to-digital converter (TDC) records the drift time enabling the reconstruction of high precision 3D track segments. Recently GridPixes were produced on full wafer scale, to meet the demand for more reliable and cheaper devices in large quantities. In a recent beam test the contribution of both diffusion and time walk to the spatial and angular resolutions of a GridPix detector with a 1.2 mm drift gap are studied in detail. In addition long term tests show that in a significant fraction of the chips the protection layer successfully quenches discharges, preventing harm to the chip. },

	Abstract = {A technology for manufacturing an aluminium grid onto a silicon wafer has been developed. The grid is fixed parallel and precisely to the wafer (anode) surface at a distance of 50 μ m by means of insulating pillars. When some 400 V are applied between the grid and (anode) wafer, gas multiplication occurs: primary electrons from the drift space above the grid enter the holes and cause electron avalanches in the high-field region between the grid and the anode. Production and operational characteristics of the device are described. With this newly developed technology, CMOS (pixel) readout chips can be covered with a gas multiplication grid. Such a chip forms, together with the grid, an integrated device which can be applied as readout in a wide field of gaseous detectors. },

	Abstract = {This work presents the design, implementation and test of prototype modules of a Time Projection Chamber based on Micromegas amplification technology which was built in view of the future International Linear Collider. The main goals of this development are to investigate the performance of the detector and to demonstrate the feasibility of extremely compact and low power readout electronics. We based the front-end electronics on the AFTER chip, a 72-channel ASIC originally built for the T2K experiment, and integrated it with new hardware, mechanics and cooling to read out the 1728 channels of a detector module while staying confined in the available area of ~220 cm2. The digital part of a module is based on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA which interfaces to the 24 AFTER chips used for the readout. We present the operation of a vertical slice of the complete detector and readout system. In particular, our tests show that the resistive anode of the Micromegas detector, which is primarily designed to improve tracking resolution, allows operation without the spark protection circuit normally required on each readout channel.},

In addition to the initial optical survey and corrections for electronics and mechanical effects the use of tracks in a special software alignment is essential. A number of different methods is in use, ranging from simple residual-based procedures to complex fitting systems with many thousands of parameters. The methods are reviewed with respect to their mathematical basis and accuracy, and to aspects of the practical realization. },

The first is a C ++ application framework that provides a platform for the distributed development of reconstruction and analysis software and the second is a conditions data toolkit.

	Abstract = {We introduce the gas electrons multiplier (GEM), a composite grid consisting of two metal layers separated by a thin insulator, etched with a regular matrix of open channels. A GEM grid with the electrodes kept at a suitable difference of potential, inserted in a gas detector on the path of drifting electrons, allows to pre-amplify the charge drifting through the channels. Coupled to other devices, multiwire or microstrip chambers, it permits to obtain higher gains, or to operate in less critical conditions. The separation of sensitive and detection volumes offers other advantages: a built-in delay, a strong suppression of photon feedback. Applications are foreseen in high rate tracking and Cherenkov Ring Imaging detectors. Multiple GEM grids assembled in the same gas volume allow to obtain large effective amplification factors in a succession of steps.},

	Abstract = {The APV25 is a 128-channel analogue pipeline chip for the readout of silicon microstrip detectors in the CMS tracker at the LHC. Each channel comprises a low noise amplifier, a 192-cell analogue pipeline and a deconvolution readout circuit. Output data are transmitted on a single differential current output via an analogue multiplexer. The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.25 \micro\meter CMOS process to take advantage of the radiation tolerance, lower noise and power, and high circuit density. Experimental characterisation of this circuit shows full functionality and good performance both in pre- and post-irradiation (20 Mrad) conditions. The measured noise is significantly reduced compared to earlier APV versions. A description of the design and results from measurements prior to irradiation are presented. },

The scalable architecture, achieved using multi-Gbps point-to-point links with no buses involved, allows the user to tailor the system size to his needs. The modular topology enables the integration of different front-end ASICs, giving the user the possibility to use the most appropriate front-end for his purpose or to build a heterogeneous experimental apparatus which integrates different front-ends into the same DAQ system.

	Abstract = {The Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (THGEM) is a simple and robust electrode suitable for large area detectors. In this work the results of extensive comparative studies of the physical properties of different THGEM-based structures are reviewed. The focus is on newly suggested THGEM-like WELL configurations as well as on recently developed characterization methods. The WELL structures are single-sided THGEM electrodes directly coupled to different anode readout electrodes; they differ by the coupling concept of the bottom THGEM electrode to the metallic readout pads. The results are compared to that of traditional double-sided THGEM electrodes followed by induction gaps --- in some cases with moderate additional multiplication within the gap. We compare the different configurations in terms of gain, avalanche extension, discharge-rate and magnitude as well as rate capabilities over a broad dynamic range --- exploiting a method that mimics highly ionizing particles in the laboratory. We report on recent studies of avalanche distribution in THGEM holes using optical readout.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of first studies of the Resistive Plate WELL (RPWELL): a single-faced THGEM coupled to a copper anode via a resistive layer of high bulk resistivity. We explored various materials of different bulk resistivity (10 9 -10 12 $\Omega$ cm) and thickness (0.4-4 mm). Our most successful prototype, with a 0.6 mm resistive plate of ~ 10 9 $\Omega$ cm, achieved gains of up to 10 5 with 8 keV x-ray in Ne/5\%CH 4 ; a minor 30\% gain drop occurred with a rate increase from 10 to 10 4 Hz/mm 2 . The detector displayed a full ``discharge-free'' operation --- even when exposed to high primary ionization events. We present the RPWELL detector concept and compare its performance to that of other previously explored THGEM configurations --- in terms of gain, its curves, dependence on rate, and the response to high ionization. The robust Resistive Plate WELL concept is a step forward in the Micro-Pattern Gas-Detector family, with numerous potential applications.},

Detection efficiencies in the 98\% range were recorded with an average pad-multiplicity of ~ 1.1. The resistive anode resulted in efficient discharge damping, with few-volt potential drops; discharge probabilities were ~ 10 -7 for muons and 10 -6 for pions in the double-stage configuration, at rates of a few kHz/cm 2 . These results, together with the robustness of THGEM electrodes against spark damage and their suitability for economic production over large areas, make THGEM-based detectors highly competitive compared to the other technologies considered for the SiD-DHCAL.},

	Abstract = {In this work we investigate three variants of single amplification-stage detector elements; they comprise THGEM electrodes closed at their bottom with metallic or resistive anodes to form WELL-type configurations. We present the results of a comparative study of the Thick-WELL (THWELL), Resistive-WELL (RWELL) and Segmented Resistive WELL (SRWELL) focusing on their performance in terms of spark-quenching capability, gain variation with position and counting rate, pulse shapes and signal propagation to neighboring readout pads; the study included both 30 $\times$ 30 and 100 $\times$ 100 mm 2 detectors. It was shown that the WELL structures with resistive anodes offer stable operation even in a highly ionizing environment with effective spark quenching, as well as higher gain than the standard THGEM/inductiongap configuration. Cross talk between neighboring readout pads (here 10 $\times$ 10 mm 2 in size) was shown to be effectively eliminated in the segmented detector with a conductive grid underneath the resistive layer. The latter multiplier should allow for the design of very thin detectors, e.g. sampling elements in digital hadronic calorimeters planned for experiments in future linear colliders.},

	Abstract = {We report on the results of an extensive R\&D program aimed at the evaluation of Thick-Gas Electron Multipliers (THGEM) as potential active elements for Digital Hadron Calorimetry (DHCAL). Results are presented on efficiency, pad multiplicity and discharge probability of a 10x10 cm 2 prototype detector with 1 cm 2 readout pads. The detector is comprised of single- or double-THGEM multipliers coupled to the pad electrode either directly or via a resistive anode. Investigations employing standard discrete electronics and the KPiX readout system have been carried out both under laboratory conditions and with muons and pions at the CERN RD51 test beam. For detectors having a charge-induction gap, it has been shown that even a ~ 6 mm thick single-THGEM detector reached detection efficiencies above 95\%, with pad-hit multiplicity of 1.1--1.2 per event; discharge probabilities were of the order of 10 -6 -10 -5 sparks/trigger, depending on the detector structure and gain. Preliminary beam tests with a WELL hole-structure, closed by a resistive anode, yielded discharge probabilities of < 2x10 -6 for an efficiency of ~ 95\%. Methods are presented to reduce charge-spread and pad multiplicity with resistive anodes. The new method showed good prospects for further evaluation of very thin THGEM-based detectors as potential active elements for DHCAL, with competitive performances, simplicity and robustness. Further developments are in course.},

To achieve such a low mass, ultra-thin hybrid pixel detectors are foreseen, while the mass for cooling and services will be reduced by implementing a power-pulsing scheme that takes advantage of the low duty cycle of the accelerator. The principal aim is to achieve significant power reduction without compromising the power integrity supplied to the front-end electronics. A power-pulsing scheme is proposed for the analog electronics and its electrical features are discussed on the basis of measurements.},

	Abstract = {Hybrid pixel detectors are now widely used in particle physics experiments and at synchrotron light sources. They have also stimulated growing interest in other fields and, in particular, in medical imaging. Through the continuous pursuit of miniaturization in CMOS it has been possible to increase the functionality per pixel while maintaining or even shrinking pixel dimensions. The main constraint on the more extensive use of the technology in all fields is the cost of module building and the difficulty of covering large areas seamlessly [1]. On another hand, in the field of electronic component integration, a new approach has been developed in the last years, called 3D Integration. This concept, based on using the vertical axis for component integration, allows improving the global performance of complex systems. Thanks to this technology, the cost and the form factor of components could be decreased and the performance of the global system could be enhanced. In the field of radiation imaging detectors the advantages of 3D Integration come from reduced inter chip dead area even on large surfaces and from improved detector construction yield resulting from the use of single chip 4-side buttable tiles [2]. For many years, numerous R\&D centres and companies have put a lot of effort into developing 3D integration technologies and today, some mature technologies are ready for prototyping and production [3]. The core technology of 3D integration is the TSV (Through Silicon Via) and for many years LETI has developed those technologies for various types of applications [4, 5, 6]. In this paper we will present how one of the TSV approaches developed by LETI, called TSV last, has been applied to a readout wafer containing readout chips intended for a hybrid pixel detector assembly [7, 8].},

	Abstract = {Abstract High-voltage particle detectors in commercial CMOS technologies are a detector family that allows implementation of low-cost, thin and radiation-tolerant detectors with a high time resolution. In the R/D phase of the development, a radiation tolerance of 10 15 n eq / cm 2, nearly 100\% detection efficiency and a spatial resolution of about 3 um were demonstrated. Since 2011 the HV detectors have first applications: the technology is presently the main option for the pixel detector of the planned Mu3e experiment at PSI (Switzerland). Several prototype sensors have been designed in a standard 180 nm HV CMOS process and successfully tested. Thanks to its high radiation tolerance, the HV detectors are also seen at CERN as a promising alternative to the standard options for ATLAS upgrade and CLIC. In order to test the concept, within ATLAS upgrade R/D, we are currently exploring an active pixel detector demonstrator HV2FEI4; also implemented in the 180 nm HV process. },

@article{Llopart2007485,
	Abstract = {A novel approach for the readout of a TPC at the future linear collider is to use a CMOS pixel detector combined with some kind of gas gain grid. A first test using the photon counting chip Medipix2 with GEM or Micromegas demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach. Although this experiment demonstrated that single primary electrons could be detected the chip did not provide information on the arrival time of the electron in the sensitive gas volume nor did it give any indication of the quantity of charge detected. The Timepix chip uses an external clock with a frequency of up to 100 MHz as a time reference. Each pixel contains a preamplifier, a discriminator with hysteresis and 4-bit DAC for threshold adjustment, synchronization logic and a 14-bit counter with overflow control. Moreover, each pixel can be independently configured in one of four different modes: masked mode: pixel is off, counting mode: 1-count for each signal over threshold, TOT mode: the counter is incremented continuously as long as the signal is above threshold, and arrival time mode: the counter is incremented continuously from the time the first hit arrives until the end of the shutter. The chip resembles very much the Medipix2 chip physically and can be readout using slightly modified versions of the various existing systems. This paper presents the main features of the new design, electrical measurements and some first images. },

@article{1748-0221-10-03-C03025,
	Abstract = {The precision physics needs at TeV-scale linear electron-positron colliders (ILC and CLIC) require a vertex-detector system with excellent flavour-tagging capabilities through a measurement of displaced vertices. This is essential, for example, for an explicit measurement of the Higgs decays to pairs of b -quarks, c -quarks and gluons. Efficient identification of top quarks in the decay t $\to$ Wb will give access to the ttH -coupling measurement. In addition to those requirements driven by physics arguments, the CLIC bunch structure calls for hit timing at the few-ns level. As a result, the CLIC vertex-detector system needs to have excellent spatial resolution, full geometrical coverage extending to low polar angles, extremely low material budget, low occupancy facilitated by time-tagging, and sufficient heat removal from sensors and readout. These considerations challenge current technological limits. A detector concept based on hybrid pixel-detector technology is under development for the CLIC vertex detector. It comprises fast, low-power and small-pitch readout ASICs implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology (CLICpix) coupled to ultra-thin planar or active HV-CMOS sensors via low-mass interconnects. The power dissipation of the readout chips is reduced by means of power pulsing, allowing for a cooling system based on forced gas flow. This contribution reviews the requirements and design optimisation for the CLIC vertex detector and gives an overview of recent R\&D achievements in the domains of sensors, readout and detector integration.},

	Abstract = {The intrinsic time structure of hadronic showers influences the timing capability and the required integration time of hadronic calorimeters in particle physics experiments, and depends on the active medium and on the absorber of the calorimeter. With the CALICE T3B experiment, a setup of 15 small plastic scintillator tiles read out with Silicon Photomultipliers, the time structure of showers is measured on a statistical basis with high spatial and temporal resolution in sampling calorimeters with tungsten and steel absorbers. The results are compared to GEANT4 (version 9.4 patch 03) simulations with different hadronic physics models. These comparisons demonstrate the importance of using high precision treatment of low-energy neutrons for tungsten absorbers, while an overall good agreement between data and simulations for all considered models is observed for steel.},

	Abstract = {Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) offer the possibility to build pixel detectors and tracking layers with high spatial resolution and low material budget in commercial CMOS processes. Significant progress has been made in the field of MAPS in recent years, and they are now considered for the upgrades of the LHC experiments. This contribution will focus on MAPS detectors developed for the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS) upgrade and manufactured in the TowerJazz 180 nm CMOS imaging sensor process on wafers with a high resistivity epitaxial layer. Several sensor chip prototypes have been developed and produced to optimise both charge collection and readout circuitry. The chips have been characterised using electrical measurements, radioactive sources and particle beams. The tests indicate that the sensors satisfy the ALICE requirements and first prototypes with the final size of $\SI{1.5 \times 3}{cm^2}$ have been produced in the first half of 2014. This contribution summarises the characterisation measurements and presents first results from the full-scale chips.},

The requirement of as light as possible construction is driven by physics, in particular by measurements requiring determination of the quark charge sign.

	Abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is studying the physics of strongly interacting matter, and in particular the properties of the Quark--Gluon Plasma (QGP), using proton--proton, proton--nucleus and nucleus--nucleus collisions at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The ALICE Collaboration is preparing a major upgrade of the experimental apparatus, planned for installation in the second long LHC shutdown in the years 2018--2019. A key element of the ALICE upgrade is the construction of a new, ultra-light, high-resolution Inner Tracking System (ITS) based on monolithic CMOS pixel detectors. The primary focus of the ITS upgrade is on improving the performance for detection of heavy-flavour hadrons, and of thermal photons and low-mass di-electrons emitted by the QGP. With respect to the current detector, the new Inner Tracking System will significantly enhance the determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, the tracking efficiency at low transverse momenta, and the read-out rate capabilities. This will be obtained by seven concentric detector layers based on a \SI{50}{\micro\meter} thick CMOS pixel sensor with a pixel pitch of about $\SI{30\times30}{\micro\meter}$  2 . This document, submitted to the LHCC (LHC experiments Committee) in September 2013, presents the design goals, a summary of the R\&D activities, with focus on the technical implementation of the main detector components, and the projected detector and physics performance.},

A 1 cm2 segmentation can be obtained using semi-digital embedded electronics together with an efficient gas detector. The Glass RPC is an excellent candidate that was successfully used in the BELLE experiment. To apply the PFA efficiently it is necessary to reduce the detector dead zones while keeping it as thin as possible. We have designed and constructed very thin GRPCs for which the number and volume of spacers as well as the area of the gas-tight frame are minimized. New resistive coatings were used to reduce cross-talk. Attempts to improve on the high voltage connection were made and novel gas distribution schemes were tested. },

	Abstract = {The particle flow approach to calorimetry can provide unprecedented jet energy resolution at a future high energy collider, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC). However, the use of particle flow calorimetry at the proposed multi-TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) poses a number of significant new challenges. At higher jet energies, detector occupancies increase, and it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve energy deposits from individual particles. The experimental conditions at CLIC are also significantly more challenging than those at previous electron--positron colliders, with increased levels of beam-induced backgrounds combined with a bunch spacing of only 0.5 ns. This paper describes the modifications made to the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm to improve the jet energy reconstruction for jet energies above 250 GeV. It then introduces a combination of timing and pT cuts that can be applied to reconstructed particles in order to significantly reduce the background. A systematic study is performed to understand the dependence of the jet energy resolution on the jet energy and angle, and the physics performance is assessed via a study of the energy and mass resolution of W and Z particles in the presence of background at CLIC. Finally, the missing transverse momentum resolution is presented, and the fake missing momentum is quantified. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that high granularity particle flow calorimetry leads to a robust and high resolution reconstruction of jet energies and di-jet masses at CLIC. },

	Abstract = {The Particle Flow (PFlow) approach to calorimetry promises to deliver unprecedented jet energy resolution for experiments at future high energy colliders such as the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC). This paper describes the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm which is then used to perform the first systematic study of the potential of high granularity PFlow calorimetry. For simulated events in the ILD detector concept, a jet energy resolution of $\sigma$ E / E $\leq$ 3.8 \% is achieved for 40--400 GeV jets. This result, which demonstrates that high granularity PFlow calorimetry can meet the challenging ILC jet energy resolution goals, does not depend strongly on the details of the Monte Carlo modelling of hadronic showers. The PandoraPFA algorithm is also used to investigate the general features of a collider detector optimised for high granularity PFlow calorimetry. Finally, a first study of the potential of high granularity PFlow calorimetry at a multi-TeV lepton collider, such as CLIC, is presented. },

For the electromagnetic calorimeter, the current baseline choice is a high granularity sampling calorimeter with tungsten as absorber and silicon detectors as sensitive material. A ``physics prototype'' has been constructed, consisting of thirty sensitive layers. Each layer has an active area of 18 $\times$ 18 cm 2 and a pad size of 1 $\times$ 1 cm 2 . The absorber thickness totals 24 radiation lengths. It has been exposed in 2006 and 2007 to electron and hadron beams at the DESY and CERN beam test facilities, using a wide range of beam energies and incidence angles. In this paper, the prototype and the data acquisition chain are described and a summary of the data taken in the 2006 beam tests is presented. The methods used to subtract the pedestals and calibrate the detector are detailed. The signal-over-noise ratio has been measured at 7.63$\pm$0.01. Some electronics features have been observed; these lead to coherent noise and crosstalk between pads, and also crosstalk between sensitive and passive areas. The performance achieved in terms of uniformity and stability is presented.},

	Abstract = {The Payload for Antimatter-Matter Exploration and Light Nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA), primarily designed to directly measure antiparticles (antiprotons and positrons) in the cosmic radiation, was launched successfully on June 15th, 2006, and, since then, it is in continuous data taking. The calorimeter of the PAMELA apparatus has been designed to identify antiprotons from an electron background and positrons from a background of protons with high efficiency and rejection power. It is a sampling silicon-tungsten imaging calorimeter, which comprises 44 single-sided silicon sensor planes (\SI{380}{\micro\meter} thick) interleaved with 22 plates of tungsten absorber (0.74 $\times$ 0 each). It is the first silicon-tungsten calorimeter to be launched in space. In this work we present the in-orbit performance of the calorimeter, including the measured identification capabilities. The calorimeter provides a proton rejection factor of ~10 5 while keeping a high efficiency in selecting electrons and positrons, thus fulfilling the identification power needed to reach the primary scientific objectives of PAMELA. We show also that, after almost two years of operation in space, the calorimeter is still performing nominally.},

@article{1748-0221-8-01-C01027,
	Abstract = {For the future e+ e- International Linear Collider (ILC) the ASIC SPIROC (Silicon Photomultiplier Integrated Read-Out Chip) was designed to read out the Analog Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) equipped with Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM). It is an evolution of the FLC_SiPM chip designed by the OMEGA group in 2005. SPIROC2 [ 1 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/6/01/C01098] ] was realized in AMS SiGe 0.35 \micro\meter technology [ 2 [http://asic.austriamicrosystems.com/] ] and developed to match the requirements of large dynamic range, low noise, low consumption, high precision and large number of read-out channels. This ASIC is a very front-end read-out chip that integrates 36 self triggered channels with variable gain to achieve charge and time measurements. The charge measurement must be performed from 1 up to 2000 photo-electrons (p.e.) corresponding to 160 fC up to 320 pC for SiPM gain 10 6 . The time measurement is performed with a coarse 12-bit counter related to the bunch crossing clock (up to 5 MHz) and a fine time ramp based on this clock (down to 200 ns) to achieve a resolution of 1 ns. An analog memory array with a depth of 16 for each channel is used to store the time information and the charge measurement. The analog memory content (time and charge) is digitized thanks to an internal 12-bit Wilkinson ADC. The data is then stored in a 4kbytes RAM. A complex digital part is necessary to manage all these features and to transfer the data to the DAQ. SPIROC2 is the second generation of the SPIROC ASIC family designed in 2008 by the OMEGA group. A very similar version (SPIROC2c) was submitted in February 2012 to improve the noise performance and also to integrate a new TDC (Time to Digital Converter) structure. This paper describes SPIROC2 and SPIROC2c ASICs and illustrates the main characteristics thank to a series of measurements.},

	Abstract = {MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure (MICROMEGAS) and Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) detectors are two candidates for the active medium of a Digital Hadronic CALorimeter (DHCAL) as part of a high energy physics experiment at a future linear collider (ILC/CLIC). Physics requirements lead to a highly granular hadronic calorimeter with up to thirty million channels with probably only hit information (digital readout calorimeter). To validate the concept of digital hadronic calorimetry with such small cell size, the construction and test of a cubic meter technological prototype, made of 40 planes of one square meter each, is necessary. This technological prototype would contain about 400 000 electronic channels, thus requiring the development of front-end ASIC. Based on the experience gained with previous ASIC that were mounted on detectors and tested in particle beams, a new ASIC called MICROROC has been developped. This paper summarizes the caracterisation campaign that was conducted on this new chip as well as its integration into a large area Micromegas chamber of one square meter.},

	Abstract = {HARDROC (HAdronic Rpc Detector Read Out Chip) is the very front end chip designed for the readout of the RPC or Micromegas foreseen for the Digital HAdronic CALorimeter (DHCAL) of the future International Linear Collider and designed within the CALICE collaboration. The very fine granularity of the ILC hadronic calorimeters (1cm2 pads) implies a huge number of electronics channels (4 105 /m3) which is a new feature of ``imaging'' calorimetry. Moreover, for compactness, the chips must be embedded inside the detector making crucial the reduction of the power consumption to 10 $\mu$Watt per channel. This is achieved using power pulsing, made possible by the ILC bunch pattern (1 ms of acquisition data for 199 ms of dead time). HARDROC readout is a semi-digital readout with three thresholds which allows both good tracking and coarse energy measurement, and also integrates on chip data storage. The overall performance of HARDROC will be described with detailed measurements of all the characteristics. Hundreds of chips have indeed been produced and tested before being mounted on printed boards developed for the readout of large scale (1m2) RPC and Micromegas prototypes. These prototypes have been tested with cosmics and also in testbeam at CERN between 2008 and 2010 to evaluate the performance of different kinds of GRPCs and to validate the semi-digital electronics readout system in beam conditions. A production of 10 000 chips has been launched in March 2010 to equip 40 GRPC planes (400 000 channels) of a 1 cubic meter detector that will be tested in 2011.},

	Abstract = {Today vertically integrated circuits, (a.k.a. 3D integrated circuits) is a popular topic in many trade journals. The many advantages of these circuits have been described such as higher speed due to shorter trace lenghts, the ability to reduce cross talk by placing analog and digital circuits on different levels, higher circuit density without the going to smaller feature sizes, lower interconnect capacitance leading to lower power, reduced chip size, and different processing for the various layers to optimize performance. There are some added advantages specifically for MAPS (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors) in High Energy Physics: four side buttable pixel arrays, 100\% diode fill factor, the ability to move PMOS transistors out of the diode sensing layer, and a increase in channel density. Fermilab began investigating 3D circuits in 2006. Many different bonding processes have been described for fabricating 3D circuits [ 1 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9783527623051] ]. Fermilab has used three different processes to fabricate several circuits for specific applications in High Energy Physics and X-ray imaging. This paper covers some of the early 3D work at Fermilab and then moves to more recent activities. The major processes we have used are discussed and some of the problems encountered are described. An overview of pertinent 3D circuit designs is presented along with test results thus far.},

The multiplicity, length and angular distribution of identified track segments are compared to GEANT4 simulations with several different shower models.

	Abstract = {Lepton colliders are considered as options to complement and to extend the physics programme at the Large Hadron Collider. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is an e+ e- collider under development aiming at centre-of-mass energies of up to 3 TeV. For experiments at CLIC, a hadron sampling calorimeter with tungsten absorber is proposed. Such a calorimeter provides sufficient depth to contain high-energy showers, while allowing a compact size for the surrounding solenoid. A fine-grained calorimeter prototype with tungsten absorber plates and scintillator tiles read out by silicon photomultipliers was built and exposed to particle beams at CERN. Results obtained with electrons, pions and protons of momenta up to 10 GeV are presented in terms of energy resolution and shower shape studies. The results are compared with several GEANT4 simulation models in order to assess the reliability of the Monte Carlo predictions relevant for a future experiment at CLIC.},

	Abstract = {Calorimeters with a high granularity are a fundamental requirement of the Particle Flow paradigm. This paper focuses on the prototype of a hadron calorimeter with analog readout, consisting of thirty-eight scintillator layers alternating with steel absorber planes. The scintillator plates are finely segmented into tiles individually read out via Silicon Photomultipliers. The presented results are based on data collected with pion beams in the energy range from 8 GeV to 100 GeV. The fine segmentation of the sensitive layers and the high sampling frequency allow for an excellent reconstruction of the spatial development of hadronic showers. A comparison between data and Monte Carlo simulations is presented, concerning both the longitudinal and lateral development of hadronic showers and the global response of the calorimeter. The performance of several GEANT4 physics lists with respect to these observables is evaluated.},

	Abstract = {A prototype module for an International Linear Collider (ILC) detector was built, installed, and tested between 2006 and 2009 at CERN and Fermilab as part of the CALICE test beam program, in order to study the possibilities of extending energy sampling behind a hadronic calorimeter and to study the possibilities of providing muon tracking. The ``tail catcher/muon tracker'' (TCMT) is composed of 320 extruded scintillator strips (dimensions 1000 $\times$ 50 $\times$ 5 mm 3 ) packaged in 16 one-meter square planes interleaved between steel plates. The scintillator strips were read out with wavelength shifting fibers and silicon photomultipliers. The planes were arranged with alternating horizontal and vertical strip orientations. Data were collected for muons and pions in the energy range 6 GeV to 80 GeV. Utilizing data taken in 2006, this paper describes the design and construction of the TCMT, performance characteristics, and a beam-based evaluation of the ability of the TCMT to improve hadronic energy resolution in a prototype ILC detector. For a typical configuration of an ILC detector with a coil situated outside a calorimeter system with a thickness of 5.5 nuclear interaction lengths, a TCMT would improve relative energy resolution by 6-16\% for pions between 20 and 80 GeV.},

	Abstract = {The studies presented in this paper provide a first experimental test of the Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) concept using data recorded in high granularity calorimeters. Pairs of overlaid pion showers from CALICE 2007 test beam data are reconstructed by the PandoraPFA program developed to implement PFA for a future lepton collider. Recovery of a neutral hadron's energy in the vicinity of a charged hadron is studied. The impact of the two overlapping hadron showers on energy resolution is investigated. The dependence of the confusion error on the distance between a 10 GeV neutral hadron and a charged pion is derived for pion energies of 10 and 30 GeV which are representative of a 100 GeV jet. The comparison of these test beam data results with Monte Carlo simulation is done for various hadron shower models within the GEANT4 framework. The results for simulated particles and for beam data are in good agreement thereby providing support for previous simulation studies of the power of Particle Flow Calorimetry at a future lepton collider.},

	Abstract = {The energy resolution of a highly granular 1 m 3 analogue scintillator-steel hadronic calorimeter is studied using charged pions with energies from 10 GeV to 80 GeV at the CERN SPS. The energy resolution for single hadrons is determined to be approximately 58\%/$\sqrt{E}$ /GeV. This resolution is improved to approximately 45\%/$\sqrt{E}$ /GeV with software compensation techniques. These techniques take advantage of the event-by-event information about the substructure of hadronic showers which is provided by the imaging capabilities of the calorimeter. The energy reconstruction is improved either with corrections based on the local energy density or by applying a single correction factor to the event energy sum derived from a global measure of the shower energy density. The application of the compensation algorithms to geant 4 simulations yield resolution improvements comparable to those observed for real data.},

	Abstract = {The CALICE collaboration is studying the design of high performance electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for future International Linear Collider detectors. For the hadronic calorimeter, one option is a highly granular sampling calorimeter with steel as absorber and scintillator layers as active material. High granularity is obtained by segmenting the scintillator into small tiles individually read out via silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM). A prototype has been built, consisting of thirty-eight sensitive layers, segmented into about eight thousand channels. In 2007 the prototype was exposed to positrons and hadrons using the CERN SPS beam, covering a wide range of beam energies and angles of incidence. The challenge of cell equalization and calibration of such a large number of channels is best validated using electromagnetic processes. The response of the prototype steel-scintillator calorimeter, including linearity and uniformity, to electrons is investigated and described.},

	Abstract = {An analog hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) prototype of 5.3 nuclear interaction lengths thickness has been constructed by members of the CALICE Collaboration. The AHCAL prototype consists of a 38-layer sandwich structure of steel plates and highly-segmented scintillator tiles that are read out by wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to SiPMs. The signal is amplified and shaped with a custom-designed ASIC. A calibration/monitoring system based on LED light was developed to monitor the SiPM gain and to measure the full SiPM response curve in order to correct for non-linearity. Ultimately, the physics goals are the study of hadron shower shapes and testing the concept of particle flow. The technical goal consists of measuring the performance and reliability of 7608 SiPMs. The AHCAL was commissioned in test beams at DESY and CERN. The entire prototype was completed in 2007 and recorded hadron showers, electron showers and muons at different energies and incident angles in test beams at CERN and Fermilab.},

@phdthesis{figueras:2013PhD,
	Abstract = {The next generation of particle colliders will be characterized by linear lepton colliders, where the collisions between electrons and positrons will allow to study in great detail the new particle discovered at CERN in 2012 (presumably the Higgs boson). At present time, there are two alternative projects underway, namely the ILC (International Linear Collider) and CLIC (Compact LInear Collider). From the detector point of view, the physics aims at these particle colliders impose such extreme requirements, that there is no sensor technology available in the market that can fulfill all of them. As a result, several new detector systems are being developed in parallel with the accelerator. This thesis presents the development of a GAPD (Geiger-mode Avalanche PhotoDiode) pixel detector aimed mostly at particle tracking at future linear colliders. GAPDs offer outstanding qualities to meet the challenging requirements of ILC and CLIC, such as an extraordinary high sensitivity, virtually infinite gain and ultra-fast response time, apart from compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. In particular, GAPD detectors enable the direct conversion of a single particle event onto a CMOS digital pulse in the sub-nanosecond time scale without the utilization of either preamplifiers or pulse shapers. As a result, GAPDs can be read out after each single bunch crossing, a unique quality that none of its competitors can offer at the moment. In spite of all these advantages, GAPD detectors suffer from two main problems. On the one side, there exist noise phenomena inherent to the sensor, which induce noise pulses that cannot be distinguished from real particle events and also worsen the detector occupancy to unacceptable levels. On the other side, the fill-factor is too low and gives rise to a reduced detection efficiency. Solutions to the two problems commented that are compliant with the severe specifications of the next generation of particle colliders have been thoroughly investigated. The design and characterization of several single pixels and small arrays that incorporate some elements to reduce the intrinsic noise generated by the sensor are presented. The sensors and the readout circuits have been monolithically integrated in a conventional HV-CMOS 0.35 \micro\meter process. Concerning the readout circuits, both voltage-mode and current-mode options have been considered. Moreover, the time-gated operation has also been explored as an alternative to reduce the detected sensor noise. The design and thorough characterization of a prototype GAPD array, also monolithically integrated in a conventional 0.35 \micro\meter HV-CMOS process, is presented in the thesis as well. The detector consists of 10 rows x 43 columns of pixels, with a total sensitive area of 1 mm x 1 mm. The array is operated in a time-gated mode and read out sequentially by rows. The efficiency of the proposed technique to reduce the detected noise is shown with a wide variety of measurements. Further improved results are obtained with the reduction of the working temperature. Finally, the suitability of the proposed detector array for particle detection is shown with the results of a beam-test campaign conducted at CERN-SPS (European Organization for Nuclear Research-Super Proton Synchrotron). Apart from that, a series of additional approaches to improve the performance of the GAPD technology are proposed. The benefits of integrating a GAPD pixel array in a 3D process in terms of overcoming the fill-factor limitation are examined first. The design of a GAPD detector in the Global Foundries 130 nm/Tezzaron 3D process is also presented. Moreover, the possibility to obtain better results in light detection applications by means of the time-gated operation or correction techniques is analyzed too.},

	Abstract = {A major upgrade of the current Japanese B-Factory (KEK-B) is planned for 2015. Together with this new machine (SuperKEK-B) also a new detector, Belle-II, will be operated to fully exploit the planned luminosity of 8 $\times$ 10 35 s -1 cm -2 (40 times larger than previously). One of the major changes in the new experiment will be the introduction of a new sub-detector, close to the interaction point, to allow a precise reconstruction of the decay vertices of the B meson systems. This pixel detector, based on the DEPFET technology, will consist of 20 ladder modules arranged in two cylindrical layers around the beam pipe. Each of the modules will be read-out independently by a combination of analog and digital ASICs placed at both ends of each sensor. The digital chip, the Data Handling Processor (DHP), is designed to control the readout chain and to pre-process and to compress the data. The chip structure and the latest results about its performance optimization will be presented.},

	Abstract = {The current-mode ADC chip-prototype for the readout of DEPFET particle pixel-detectors with high spatial resolution is presented. The planned application of these DEPFET detectors are vertex detectors for ILC and Belle II. The chip has 72 ADC channels. Every channel processes the input signals using two cyclic ADCs that operate in parallel. The cyclic ADCs are based on current-mode memory cells. The measured signal to noise ratio of one ADC is about 660 (fast ADC variant: 520) and its conversion time is 320 ns (fast ADC variant: 160 ns) in the case of 8-bit resolution. Redundant signed-digit cyclic conversion is used for automated digital error correction. One ADC-core occupies only 40 $\times$ 55 $\micro\meter^2$, its static power consumption is 0.96 mW. Besides the two ADCs, every channel contains a regulated cascode and two additional current-mode memory cells that allow double-sampling of the input signal. Due to the need for high radiation tolerance, the chip has been implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology using enclosed NMOS gate layouts. Novel radiation-hard circuits have been used. The chip has also been used to read out a small DEPFET test matrix.},

	Abstract = {The international DEPFET collaboration is developing a silicon pixel vertex detector (PXD), based on monolithic arrays of DEPFET transistors, for the future physics experiment Belle-II at the SuperKEKB particle accelerator in Japan. The matrix elements are read out in a 'rolling shutter mode', i.e. rows are selected consecutively and all columns are read out in each cycle of < 100 ns. One of the major parts in the front-end electronics chain is the DEPFET Current Digitizer ASIC (DCDB). It is now in a close-to-final state. The chip provides 256 channels of analog-to-digital converters with a resolution of six to eight bits. Each converter features an individual dynamic offset correction circuit as well as programmable gain and bandwidth. Several operation modes using single sampling or double correlated sampling are possible. A large synthesized digital block is used for decoding and derandomization of the conversion results. The data is put out on eight 8-bit links, operating at a speed of 400 MHz. Additionally, a JTAG compatible interface is implemented for configuration and debugging purpose. Significant effort was made to reduce the power consumption of the DCDB, since both, voltage drop on the internal power buses and heat sources in the Belle-II experiment are a concern. The chip was realized on a 3.2mm $\times$ 5mm die using the UMC 180 nm CMOS technology in a multi-project wafer run, provided by EuroPractice. An extra redistribution metal layer with bump bond pads is used, allowing for flipping the chip onto the final all-silicon DEPFET sensor module. Several tests have been performed in order to prove the chip's operation and its quality in terms of noise. The results are presented.},

	Abstract = {Pulsed laser illumination constitutes an excellent tool to emulate the effects produced by the impact of highly energetic particles on electronic circuits. Numerical simulation techniques could be used to study these effects and to establish accurate relationships between the laser parameters and the particle characteristics. Unfortunately, although particle incidence can be accurately simulated, up to now, there not exist a simulation technique able to reproduce completely the effects in electronics produced by a femtosecond pulsed laser. In this paper, we explore the Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD ability to simulate the effects of pulsed laser illumination. Theoretical study of the physics of the laser--semiconductor interactions leads us to design a new simulation tool. Modifying the heavy ion generation rate included in Sentaurus TCAD, we can take into account all the theoretical predicted characteristics of femtosecond laser illumination, and reproduce the single event effects (SEE) found in experimental tests.

A characterization of two proof-of-concept prototypes with different values of the electrode resistivity was carried out using a pulsed Near Infra-Red laser. The experimental data were compared with the electrical simulation of the sensor equivalent circuit coupled to simple electronics readout circuits. The good agreement between experimental and simulation results establishes the soundness of resistive charge division method in silicon microstrip sensors and validates the developed simulation as a tool for the optimization of future sensor prototypes. Spatial resolution in the strip length direction depends on the ionizing event position. The average value obtained from the protype analysis is close to 1.2\% of the strip length for a 6 MIP signal.},

	Abstract = {The design and performance of a multichannel readout system for radiation detectors are presented. The developed 32-channel prototype system comprises fast, low-noise, front-end followed by a 10-bit multichannel digitizer and on-board FPGA data concentrator, processing the stream of digitized data with up to 6.4 Gbps rate. The operation of the whole system is managed by a microcontroller. The system can work in self-triggering mode or can be triggered externally. The implemented trigger mechanism allows for elaborate event filtering and selection of data to be transmitted to the host through the USB interface. A wide spectrum of measurements showing and quantifying the key system parameters like data transmission rate and event rate, noise, and gain are presented to prove the correct system performance. To increase the power efficiency in experiments with a non-continuous beam structure, a power pulsing mechanism is implemented and verified experimentally.},

	Abstract = {The BeamCal detector, one of the calorimeters in the forward region of the International Linear Collider detector, will serve three purposes: ensure hermeticity of the detector for small polar angles, reduce the backscattering from beamstrahlung electron-positron pairs into the detector center, and provide a low-latency signal for beam diagnostics. The BeamCal specifications in terms of noise suppression, signal charge, pulse rate, and occupancy pose unique challenges in the front end and readout electronics design. The Bean-BeamCal instrumentation IC is the integrated circuit under study to fulfill these requirements. To process the signal charge at the International Collider pulse rate, the Bean uses switched-capacitor filters and a slow reset-release technique. Each channel has a 10-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter. The Bean also features a fast feedback adder capable of providing a low latency output for beam diagnostic purposes. This work presents the design and characterization of a 3-channel prototype of the Bean built to validate concepts while the final device will comprise 32 channels.},

The latter is created upon demand by local oscillators distributed across the pixel matrix. PLL tuning of the local oscillators allows for automatic compensation of frequency fluctuations caused by process parameter, supply voltage and temperature variations. The developed PLL locks within $4~muhbox{s}$ and achieves a duty cycle of 50.75\% with a time interval error of only 23.4 ps.

	Abstract = {Due to many favorable properties it is very attractive to use Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) as gas amplification stages in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). Especially the high granularity, intrinsic suppression of ion backflow, high rate capability and almost no distortions due to E $\times$ B effects are desirable in future particle physics detectors. To fully exploit the potential of combining MPGDs and TPCs the pad size in the readout plane should be adapted to the structure size of the gas amplification stage. The Timepix chip is well suited for the use as readout chip in gaseous detector by providing metalized pads to pick up the charge. We have constructed a test chamber with a triple GEM and Timepix readout and a maximum drift distance of 26 cm. With this setup we have studied the performance of the detector in various operation environments. Different setups for tests with cosmic rays and for tests in high magnetic fields have been realized. In these environments key detector parameters such as spatial resolution have been studied in dependence on different gas mixtures. We have seen strong evidence for observation of individual electrons and a spatial resolution of down to 80 \micro\meter has been measured.},

  abstract={The SPIROC chip is a dedicated very front-end electronics for an ILC (International Linear Collider) prototype of hadronic calorimeter using Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) or Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPC) readout. This ASIC is due to equip a 10,000-channel demonstrator in 2010. SPIROC is an evolution of FLC-SiPM used for the ILC Analogue HCAL physics prototype. The first prototype of SPIROC was submitted in June 2007. It embeds cutting edge features that fulfil ILC final detector requirements. It has been realized in 0.35 μm SiGe technology. It has been developed to match the requirements of large dynamic range, low noise, low consumption, high precision and large number of readout channels needed. SPIROC is an auto-triggered, dual gain, 36-channel ASIC which allows to measure on each channel the charge from one photoelectron to 2,000 photoelectron and the time with a 100 ps accurate Time-to-digital Converter (TDC). An analogue memory array with a depth of 16 for each channel is used to store the time information and the charge measurement. A 12-bit Wilkinson Analogue-to-digital Converter (ADC) has been embedded to digitize the analogue memory content (time and charge on 2 gains). The data are then stored in a 4 Kbytes RAM. A very complex digital part has been integrated to manage all these features and to transfer the data to the DAQ which is described in Dulucq et al . After an exhaustive description, the extensive measurement results of this new front-end chip are presented.}
